# Colors

This is the documentation for the color seeding process, a standardized
system of colors inferred from numerous standards and user needs.

## Base hues

Colors are generated via a system which begins with 'base hues'.
This is a custom set of hues inspired by ISCC-NBS and the Munsell System.
It contains 'buckets' for all reasonable, semantically defined color sets;
that is, it forms a compromise between a primary/secondary/tertiary color system
and human-parsable / familiar nomenclature.

At present, it contains all tertiary definitions besides blue-purple,
which is often an arbitrary distinction on many displays. It
also adds earth-tones as aliases for darker shades of existing colors,
i.e. red-brown, brown, yellow-brown, olive-brown, and olive-green,
as well as the lighter shade pink, a monotone scale for
white/gray/black, and the simple "colorless".
